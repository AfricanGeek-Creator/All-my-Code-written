The most common type of muscular hypertrophy occurs through weightlifting or weight training. Equipment or the use thereof would be to your advantage for this form of training.

                                                    Free weights (barbells, dumbbells, kettle bells)

                                                            Body weight training requires one to get creative with their body as well as use it in the right way for these type of workouts. The advantage of using bodyweight exercises is that you are in control of your own body awareness. This form of training is usually an underrated mechanism of exercise because it requires a vast amount of energy and endurance. No equipments are needed for bodyweight training however, the use of resistant bands can be accompanied for the workouts, the pace of your training also increases. 
                                                            Exercises include a lot of plyometric movements (jumps).

These drills and methods are often used by athletes who generate a quick burst of maximal effort. Though there is a slight risk in this training style, it is a great way maximize muscular strength for your body.
Explosive exercises at their final level can also be referred to as ballistic movements.

 		 	  	    		<p>A very common type of training for people who are looking into losing weight or shred down on the fat percentage or muscle percentage they have gained. The trick about this program is understanding your body as a whole.
There are different forms of body types, and based on your specific body type, we are able to design a program that will be generated to you. This form of training, like many others should be accompanied with a diet plan that will assist in your weight loss journey. The first mistake people make while following this method of training is that they starve themselves hoping to lose the percentage of fat or muscle gained. Keep in mind your body needs a portion of food types (macronutrients) to help you perform and give you the results you desire.
Do not be like others, and make the same mistake.

                 <h2>Get Connected with Trainer</h2>
                  <p class="title-p">The RVBS strives to give people a purpose of training with the outcome of better results for each individual. 

That is why, our training methods challenge the body to a certain level in which the body feels as though these exercises are not achievable, but, they are. 

The aim of the RVBS program is to do better and train better through the science of training rather than the actual training itself, we focus on the Human Anatomy of training that way each muscle is focused primarily. 

Through a qualification in Sports Science and a BSc Human Movement Science and Sports Coaching, our trainer will help you as best as possible, the rest is up to you, do you want to change or not?</p>
